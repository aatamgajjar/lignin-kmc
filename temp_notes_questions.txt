As indicated, the package has been updated to move toward PEP8 compliance and adding test coverage.

**The neutral news:**
Many of the updates to make the package more PEP8 compliant are trivial, e.g. following the convention to make local variables lowercase and global variables all uppercase. Some variables were renamed for disambiguation or clarification. Hopefully, this will make the package more welcoming for the python community to use and update.

**The bad news:**
Previous functionality remains, but unfortunately the renaming of variables, functions, and file names (for compliance) will require previous scripts to be updated, even if only trivially (e.g. change a variable name to all lowercase).

**The good news:**
The jupyter notebooks have been updated to reflect renaming and use some new features, like built-in default parameters.

**Even better news:**
Testing has been added and with coverage of >= 90% for all files in lignin-kmc/lignin-kmc, *except* for visualization.py .


**Questions:**

From LigninPolymerizationNotebook:
"""
kb = 1.38064852e-23 # J / K
h = 6.62607004e-34 # J s
temp = 298.15 #K
kcalToJoule = 4184 / 6.022140857e23

#Correct units of the energies
energiesev = {bond : {monType : {size : energies[bond][monType][size] * kcalToJoule for size in energies[bond][monType]}
                    for monType in energies[bond] }
              for bond in energies }

#Calculate the rates of reaction
rates = {bond : {monType : { size : kb * temp / h * np.exp ( - energiesev[bond][monType][size] / kb / temp )
                            for size in energies[bond][monType]}
                 for monType in energies[bond] } #Make rates 1/ns instead of 1/s
         for bond in energies}
"""
Checking the unit; why is it called "energiesev" not "energiesj"? Why does it say "Make rates 1/ns instead of 1/s"?
Looks like 1/s to me....
